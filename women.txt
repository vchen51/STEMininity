* Raye Montague, an American naval engineer, revolutionized the way the Navy designed ships and submarines in the 1970s.
* Montague designed an entire ship in 18 hours and 26 minutes, becoming the first person to design a ship using a computer system.
* Montague graduated the University of Arkansas in 1956 with a bachelor of science degree in business, as the engineering program at the university did not admit African-American students.
* Montague joined the United States Navy in 1956 as a clerk typist and watched engineers operating until one day, where all engineers were sick, jumping to run the machine. In addition, she took computer programming at night school.

* Grace Hopper was a pioneer in the Computer Science field. She was one of the first programmers of the Harvard Mark I computer and the first compiler for a computer programming language.
* Hopper popularized the idea of machine-independent programming languages, leading to the development of COBOL, one of the first modern programming languages.
* In 1954, Hopper was named the company's first director of automatic programming, where her department released some of the first compiler-based programming languages, such as MATH-MATIC and FLOWMATIC. I
* Hopper was nicknamed as the "Amazing Grace," as well as having the U.S. Navy destroyer USS Hopper (DDG-70) and Cray XE6 "Hopper" supercomputer at NERSC named after her.
